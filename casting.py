#Python Casting

#There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.

#int
x = int(1)
y = int(7.9)
z = int(46.5)
print(z)

#float
a = float(11.0)
b = float(45)
print(b)

#str
m = str('Hi there!')
n = str(45)
print(type(n))
